moodle-filter_opencast
=====================
The opencast filter can be used to embed opencast videos.
The filter takes the HTML pasted by the opencast repository and replaces it by an iframe, which loads the [Paella Player 7](https://paellaplayer.upv.es/) with the respective opencast event.
The filter itself has no influence on the embedded content, but simply takes the information created by the repository.
Look into the documentation of [repository_opencast](https://github.com/Opencast-Moodle/moodle-repository_opencast) for details on that.

moodle-filter_opencast
=====================
The opencast filter can be used to embed opencast videos in Moodle.
Mainly it is used in combination with the opencast repository plugin to play videos in course text fields.


Description
-----------
The filter takes the HTML pasted by the opencast repository and replaces it by an iframe, which loads the [Paella Player 7](https://paellaplayer.upv.es/) with the respective opencast event.
The filter itself has no influence on the embedded content, but simply takes the information created by the repository.
Look into the documentation of [repository_opencast](https://github.com/Opencast-Moodle/moodle-repository_opencast) for details on that.
